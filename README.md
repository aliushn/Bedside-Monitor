# LifeLine

LifeLine is a low-cost Internet-of-Things vital sign monitor with real-time illness prediction which allows doctors to monitor several patients at once from a remote location. Custom circuitry interfaces sensors to measure the patient's vital signs with any Raspberry Pi. Sensor data is displayed live on a bedside monitor and is live-streamed to a cloud-based database. A webapp allows doctors to monitor all their patients live, as well as viewing patient history over the past 24 hours. Sensor data is processed in real-time by a machine learning algorithm to detect and predict a critical event in the patient's status, which is relayed to the doctor via an instant notification in the webapp.
